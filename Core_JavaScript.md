## Core JavaScript Language

This markdown will contain course content for JavaScript programming. Consider that I am totally beginner for JavaScript language. Some of my examples/syntaxing/logic may not fully correct. I will fix it as soon as I learn the better way.<br>
With that being said, let's dive into learning JavaScript. Here's the [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkZNo7MFNFg) that I follow as main course. Feel free to check it by yourself.

> Running JavaScript

You do not need to install JavaScript to run it initially. Because, most of the current used website already support the JavaScript by its own.<br>
The Tutorial has some suggestion however, I plan to use this [link](https://playcode.io/javascript) to follow along. You can change your preference for your application.
