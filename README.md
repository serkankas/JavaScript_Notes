## Learning JavaScript Language

This repository will stay as __NOTES__ for my learning process for JavaScript programming Language.<br>
As far as I see, I have to divide this learning process into atleast two if not more.

1. Core JavaScript Learning
1. Node.js Learning

From there, you can learn more framework to improve yourself to become a front-end dev or so. However, my initial goal is become Django Full Stack Developer. I ~~probably~~ won't be interested with variety framework but interested with basics.<br>
However if you want to improve yourself in JavaScript and have different goals, you can continue learning well-known frameworks like Angular, React.JS, Vue.JS, etc.

With that being said, Let's create another folder to study.

1. [Core](/Core_JavaScript.md)

HAPPY LEARNING!
